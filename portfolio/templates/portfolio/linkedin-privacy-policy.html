        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date</strong>: 20/09/2024</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>LinkedIn Post Data</strong>: We use the LinkedIn API to retrieve the website owner's most recent LinkedIn posts. This data includes the content of posts and links to LinkedIn, and is displayed publicly on the website.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: We may collect basic information such as IP addresses, browser type, and usage patterns (e.g., which pages were visited) to improve the performance and usability of the website.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Display LinkedIn Posts</strong>: We use the LinkedIn API to authenticate with the website owner's LinkedIn account and display the two most recent posts on the website. No visitor authentication is required or requested.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve Website Performance</strong>: Usage data may be used to analyze traffic patterns and improve website functionality and content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <p>As this website does not collect personal information from its visitors, no personal data is shared with third parties. However, the following details apply to the data used to display LinkedIn posts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We may use third-party services to host the website or enhance functionality (e.g., cloud hosting or content delivery networks). These services may have access to basic usage data but do not access any LinkedIn data or personal visitor information.</li>
            <li><strong>LinkedIn API</strong>: The website interacts with LinkedIn’s API to display the owner’s posts. No other information is shared with LinkedIn except for the website owner’s credentials, which are used solely to retrieve the posts.</li>

        <p>We do not store any personal data from visitors. Data related to the website owner's LinkedIn posts is updated periodically and refreshed according to LinkedIn’s API guidelines. No user information is retained or stored on the website.</p>

        <h2>5. Security of Information</h2>
        <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure our website and the limited data we collect (such as usage data). However, please be aware that no method of data transmission over the internet is fully secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of transmitted data.</p>
